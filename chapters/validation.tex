\chapter{Validation}

There are no explicit validation steps for this study as the great care was taken to include only significant results for analysis. The significance, as discussed in the previous sections, is defined through the absolute t-value. Only linear models that have a t-value magnitude above 2 is considered for analysis. This ensures that the models used are reliable and the insights drawn from them are valid. If a recap of the t-value meanings is required, please visit the sections of Methodology again. The effect of the t-values on the analysis is covered in great detail in the sections of Results.
